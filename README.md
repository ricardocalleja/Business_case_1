# Business_case_1

After changing from the oilfield üõ¢Ô∏è to IT üñ•Ô∏è I finally got my first job as <b>Business Analyst</b>. The hiring manager who eventually turn into a good friend explained to me that the job was basically to "provide IT suppport on the aplications area" which I had no clue what that meant, but for sure I accepted. So, my journey began, the first tasks changed from installing apps on end users' pc's to explain them that they needed first to power up the printer to be able to use it. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

After a few months I downloaded a report (add link) with all the ticktes and manually tag them into an arbitrary list of categories which I made up, and this is was the result: 

*Insert ugly graphic

The first finding is that in the year 2021 printing is still a headache and human beings are not able yet to defeat printers, the second case was related with an app used to scann articles and the third tag was "others"ü§°. However, talking to people, they mentioned that they didn-t report all of their IT problem because they didn't know who to ask for help, nor how to create a ticket on the company's intranet.

Here are my actions based on this analysis:

1. Creation and distribution of online trainning covering:

1.1 Solutions to all incidents users could quickly solved independently.

1.2 How to report problems on the IT website. 

2. The one I am most proud of was the identification of the root cause of an specific recurring incident (a bug between SAP and the retail back office software which affected data replication) .

3. Contributing with documenting main procedures.
